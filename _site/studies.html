        <h4>Case Studies</h4>
<h3>Complete rebranding of a fitness company</h3>

<p>Founded in 2007 as a boutique personal training firm, this company&#39;s original plan was to work with athletes and students. But after two years of no significant growth, it needed help. Without quick intervention, the company was doomed to fail.</p>

<p>After careful analysis, I made two changes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Reposition in another niche.</strong> The clients who brought in the most consistent long-term business were not athletes, but actually finance professionals with no connection whatsoever to sports. I pivoted the company away from training athletes, and positioned it instead as an expert in training finance professionals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rebrand the entire company.</strong> The change in unique selling proposition required a complete rebranding of the company, including a new name, a new design, new service packages, and a new voice for the marketing materials. I renamed the company, and rewrote all of the marketing to include language and service options that would resonate on an emotional level with my new target market.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These changes reduced advertising costs 25% over 6 months, raised client retention to 84% in about that same time, and generated $30,000 in additional revenue over the following year.</p>

<h3>200% growth at an Internet startup</h3>

<p>This small Internet startup matched attorneys with potential clients through a proprietary algorithm. The company was slowly gaining traction, and the CEO wanted to increase monthly recurring revenue by penetrating new geographic markets.</p>

<p>After assessing their current set-up, I recommended two changes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Targeted messages.</strong> The sales team was cold calling prospects in an attempt to generate business. This system was too slow, and led to a high percentage of dead ends. I focused the marketing efforts on a smaller number of higher quality leads: prospects already familiar with technology, and who were already using similar services at a similar price point. We filtered the list of leads and rewrote the call script to include language that would appeal to this specific type of prospect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Better split testing.</strong> The new call script required split testing to ensure the new language made an impact. I recommended implementing a centralized system to track how successful each version of the new script was at converting leads to paying customers.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My recommendations increased paid memberships 200% over 1 year.</p>
