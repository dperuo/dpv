        <h4>Proposals</h4>
<h3>$5 Personal Training: Targeting Big Spenders</h3>

<h4>THE CONCEPT</h4>

<p>This campaign targets new members interested in buying personal training. While this campaign is based on research conducted at XYZ Gym in New York, it could be scaled up very quickly to include other regions.</p>

<p>The campaign offers perspective new members two weeks of personal training for $5, along with access to the gym during that time.</p>

<p>We charge $5 for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>The $5 fee instantly eliminates a majority of people interested only in taking advantage of the two-week offer, with no intention of purchasing a membership or personal training. [1]</li>
<li>The fee attaches a monetary value to the personal training sessions, making the upsell to full-priced sessions easier. [2]</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on my observation of direct mailings, magazine ads and newspaper inserts, no gyms in New York are offering this type of promotion. This works in our favor and makes it difficult for potential new members to compare our offer with promotions from competitors.</p>

<h4>THE TARGET</h4>

<p>My research into the member base at XYZ Gym showed that the members who spend the most money with us buy personal training. This campaign targets potential new members already interested in personal training and who are ready to buy a large package of training sessions along with their new membership.</p>

<p>These potential new members have a high degree of disposable income and know what they want. They already have experience working with a personal trainer or, at the very least, understand the value personal training will provide and where it fits into their lifestyle.</p>

<p>These potential new members may travel often. For them, the convenience of working with a trainer is a primary concern. </p>

<h4>AVOIDING “LIVINGSOCIALITIS”</h4>

<p>There is the possibility that a small percentage of people coming into the gym with these advertisements will take advantage of the two-week offer without buying a full membership. These are most likely the same types of people that take advantage of Living Social, Groupon, and Lifebooker deals with no intention of buying the service at full price. [3]</p>

<p>If we are strategic with where we place our advertisements and flyers during this campaign, we can reduce the chance of these low-quality prospects taking advantage of our offer.</p>

<h4>TESTING AND TRACKING</h4>

<p>We would send out several different versions of this offer during the campaign and would track each variation to see which ones are effective at brining people in the door, along with how many of those people convert to paying members. This will allow us to adjust our strategy and tactics in future campaigns, maximizing our return while minimizing expenditure.</p>

<p>The mockups I included with this proposal represent three possible advertisements that could be use during the campaign.</p>

<p>The first mockup is an appeal to price: the ability to work with a personal trainer for less than the price of a fancy Starbucks coffee. This type of ad may appeal to a price-conscious person looking to try personal training.</p>

<p>The second mockup expoits social stigma: it&#39;s almost summer and you want to look sexy in a swimsuit. Working out with one of our trainers will help you do just that so you don’t become the only person wearing a t-shirt at the beach.</p>

<p>The third mockup appeals to convenience: joining XYZ Gym means that you can work with a trainer whether you are in New York, Los Angeles or Miami. Your personal training sessions are good no matter what city you’re in.</p>

<p>Mockups one and three also include expiration dates to instill a sense of urgency. </p>

<p>Other possible test variables include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Physical dimensions of the advertisement: large vs. small, full-page vs. half-page</li>
<li>Color, layout and font choices used</li>
<li>Length of the ad copy: long vs. short</li>
<li>The use of images: type, position, number included</li>
<li>Tactics used: loss aversion vs. social status vs. benefits statement</li>
<li>Price point of the offer: $5 vs. something else</li>
<li>Media used: direct mail vs. magazines vs. newspaper insert vs. online</li>
</ul>

<h4>TIME FRAME</h4>

<p>I believe this type of campaign would work best right before the summer rush: sometime between the end of tax season and the beginning of June, when everyone begins their summer schedules.</p>

<h4>POTENTIAL ROAD BLOCKS</h4>

<p>There are still a few detail that need to be clarified before the campaign can go live, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many sessions do we offer each potential new member during the trial period?</li>
<li>How will the personal trainers get paid for these sessions?</li>
<li>What are the projected short-term and long-term returns for XYZ Gym from this campaign?</li>
</ul>

<h4>NEXT STEPS</h4>

<p>The next step is to eliminate as many potential road blocks as possible. Once the road blocks are removed and the campaign gets a “green light,” a launch date can be selected and the marketing team can finalize ad copy, ad designs, and distribution channels.</p>
